Usage 🛠️

Run the Python script timetable_generator.py to automatically create a timetable 🗓️. The program assigns courses, teachers, and rooms without conflicts ✅, displays the timetable 📊, and saves it as a CSV file 💾. You can customize courses, teachers, rooms, and days directly in the script ✏️.

Future Improvements 🚀

Add time slots ⏰ for each course to make the timetable more detailed.

Include multiple sections or batches 🏫 for larger schools/colleges.

Create a web or GUI interface 🌐 for easy timetable generation.

Allow importing course and teacher data from Excel or CSV 📂 for faster setup.

Optimize the timetable for minimizing idle periods ⏳ for teachers and students.
