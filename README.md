# AI-Based-Timetable-Generation-System-
This project automatically creates a timetable for a school or college. It assigns courses, teachers, and rooms in a way that there are no clashes. Each course is scheduled only once, a teacher teaches only one class per day, and a room is used for only one course at a time. The timetable is shown in a table and saved as a CSV file.
